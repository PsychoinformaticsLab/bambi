Bambi is a high-level Bayesian model-building interface written in Python. 
It works with the [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/) probabilistic programming framework and is
designed to make it extremely easy to fit Bayesian mixed-effects models common in biology,
social sciences and other disciplines.


## Dependencies

Bambi is tested on Python 3.9+ and depends on ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas and PyMC 
(see [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/blob/main/pyproject.toml) 
for version information).

## Installation

Bambi is available from the Python Package Index at 
[https://pypi.org/project/bambi](https://pypi.org/project/bambi), alternatively it can be 
installed using Conda.

### PyPI

The latest release of Bambi can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

Alternatively, if you want the bleeding edge version of the package, you can install from
 GitHub:
   
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Conda

If you use Conda, you can also install the latest release of Bambi with the following command:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge bambi
```

## Usage

A simple fixed effects model is shown in the example below.

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import pandas as pd

# Read in a tab-delimited file containing our data
data = pd.read_table('my_data.txt', sep='\t')

# Initialize the fixed effects only model
model = bmb.Model('DV ~ IV1 + IV2', data)

# Fit the model using 1000 on each of 4 chains
results = model.fit(draws=1000, chains=4)

# Use ArviZ to plot the results
az.plot_trace(results)

# Key summary and diagnostic info on the model parameters
az.summary(results)
```
