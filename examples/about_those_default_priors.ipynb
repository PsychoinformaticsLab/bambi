Our goal is to devise a set of default priors for the regression coefficients that--in the absence of any additional information supplied by the user--will still allow one to obtain reasonable parameter estimates in general. One obviously unsatisfactory solution would be to just use, say, standard Normal distributions for all the priors, i.e.:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is better, although in principle it suffers from the same problem--that is, a user could still conceivably use variables for which even this prior is implausibly narrow (although in practice it would be unlikely). A different but related worry is that different scalings of the same variable in the same dataset--for example, due to changing the units of measurement--will lead to the prior having different levels of informativeness. This seems undesirable because scaling and shifting the variables has no meaningful consequence for traditional test statistics and standardized effect sizes (with some obvious exceptions pertaining to intercepts and models with interaction terms)."
