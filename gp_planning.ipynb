    "    * What types of GP do we support?\n",
    "        * HSGP is an obvious choice. \n",
    "        * We should evaluate whether we include other alternatives as well\n",
    "    * How do we allow for different kernels?\n",
    "        * In-formula?\n",
    "        * As its own argument?\n",

    "1.  Implement functions to represent GPs in Bambi\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Details**\n",
    "\n",
    "    I imagine implementing a function called `gp()` that will receive an argument and return it as it is.\n",
    "    However, the function itself will have a special attribute that will allow us inside Bambi detect it\n",
    "    is indeed a Gaussian Process term and treat it accordingly. We're doing something similar for censored\n",
    "    responses. We could have another function called `hsgp()` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Implement internal objects to handle GPs in Bambi  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Questions**  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Do we need a `GPTerm`? I think so\n",
    "    * How are we going to handle predictions?\n",
    "        * Having a `GPTerm` will make it easier\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Write examples\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Basic and complex examples, which will be useful as tests as well\n",
    "    * Replicate at least some of the models at Indigo\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Other questions\n",
    "    * How to bypass the GP API when using HSGP to work with the basis and the coefficients direclty,\n",
    "    so the implementation is more efficient when there are multiple GPs?\n",
    "        * Looks like a `HSGPTerm` may be the answer\n",
    "        * We still need to \"group\" the different GPs when they share the same basis\n",
    "    * How to print GP terms in the model summary?\n",
    "        * I think they could have their own section\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Resources**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Check with Bill how this works in PyMC models so we gain a better understanding"
